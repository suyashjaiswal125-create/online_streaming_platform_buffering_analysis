# Online Streaming Platform Buffering Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes buffering behavior in online streaming platforms using internet speed data.  
The goal is to understand how broadband and mobile internet speeds affect buffering time during video streaming.

This project is developed as part of **Minor 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Python only**.

## 🎯 Objective
- To analyze the relationship between internet speed and buffering time
- To identify countries with higher buffering issues
- To visualize trends using line plots and bar charts
- To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights and quality improvement

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset Name:** Internet Speed 2022  
- **Features Used:**
  - `country` – Country name
  - `broadband` – Average broadband speed (Mbps)
  - `mobile` – Average mobile internet speed (Mbps)
  - `buffering_time` – Estimated buffering time (seconds)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (Data visualization)

## 🔍 What is EDA?
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of:
- Understanding the dataset
- Checking structure and data types
- Finding patterns and relationships
- Detecting trends using visualizations

In this project, EDA helps us understand how internet speed impacts buffering.

📈 Observations

Countries with lower broadband speed experience higher buffering

Strong inverse relationship between internet speed and buffering

Buffering issues can be reduced by improving broadband infrastructure

✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how internet speed directly impacts buffering in online streaming platforms using EDA techniques.
The analysis helps understand quality improvement areas for streaming services.

🚀 Future Improvements

Use real buffering logs from streaming platforms

Add machine learning model to predict buffering

Build UI dashboard using Streamlit
